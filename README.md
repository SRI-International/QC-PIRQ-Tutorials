# Practical Intermediate Representationf or Quantum (PIRQ)

Main objective is create open-source compiler desing process tutorials for Quantum computers. This tutorials will consist of a set of modules which are:


## [Module 1](./Module%201) : Classical computers intermediate representations (IR) 


Module 1 walks through the compilation process for classical computers, and demonstrates how high-level programming languages (in particular C/C++, Rust, Julia, and Python) can be translated into LLVM intermediate representation (IR). We chose these languages because they are prevalent in the quantum computing space. On the other hand, due to the interoperable nature of LLVM, we can widen the scope of these examples with nearly any given programming languages.

## [Module 2](./Module%202) : Quantum computers intermediate representations (IR)


This contains tutorials and explanations centered around the Intermediate Representation (IR) for quantum programs. As a step towards understanding what would enable a Practical IR for Quantum, we experiment with current approaches and tools to see what works well and what seems to be lacking. The module is broken into five sections, which should be explored roughly in order.

## [Module 3](./Module%203) : Hybrid (Classical & Quantum) computers intermediate representations (IR) 


The goal of Module 3 is to demonstrate how to separate the quantum logic from classical logic and then producing unified intermediate representation (IR) from hybrid quantum-classical compilation.


## Module 4 (TODO)

Creating a full stack Quantum computing system example with chosen type of Quantum computers
